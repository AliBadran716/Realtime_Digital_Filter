## Overview

The Realtime Digital Filter Design Application is a powerful tool designed for engineers and researchers to design and analyze digital filters in real-time. This application provides a comprehensive set of features for designing, visualizing, and optimizing digital filters, making it an invaluable resource for signal processing tasks.

## Features

This desktop application facilitates the design of custom digital filters through intuitive zeros-poles placement on the z-plane. Key features include:

1. **Interactive Z-Plane Plot**: Users can place zeros and poles on the z-plane using an interactive plot, with options to modify their positions by dragging, delete them individually, or clear all zeros/poles at once. The application also provides the flexibility to add or remove conjugates for complex elements.

2. **Frequency Response Visualization**: The application generates graphs displaying the magnitude and phase response corresponding to the placed elements, offering users insights into the behavior of their designed filter.

3. **Real-time Signal Filtering**: Users can apply the designed filter to lengthy signals in real-time, with the ability to control the speed/temporal-resolution of the filtering process. The application displays the time progress of both the original signal and the filtered signal, allowing users to visualize the filtering process dynamically.

4. **Input Signal Generation**: Users can input an arbitrary real-time signal by moving the mouse on a designated area. The speed of mouse movement determines the frequency content of the generated signal, enabling users to explore different frequency ranges conveniently.

5. **Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters**: The application offers a library of all-pass filters for phase correction, allowing users to select and integrate suitable filters into their design. Users can also create custom all-pass filters by specifying parameters, giving them full control over phase correction.

6. **User-friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize the various functionalities provided. Dropdown menus and checkboxes allow for seamless enabling/disabling of added all-pass elements.

Explore the capabilities of this application by visiting the provided examples and experience the convenience of designing and implementing digital filters effortlessly.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Installation:** Clone the repository and install any required dependencies.
2. **Launch the Application:** Run the main script to launch the application.
3. **Design Filters:** Use the intuitive user interface to design digital filters, placing zeros and poles as needed.
4. **Visualize Responses:** View magnitude and phase responses in real-time, adjusting filter parameters as necessary.
5. **Apply Real-time Filtering:** Utilize the application for real-time filtering of input signals, monitoring time progress and output characteristics.
6. **Experiment with All-Pass Filters:** Explore the library of pre-defined and custom all-pass filters for phase correction.
7. **Test and Optimize:** Thoroughly test the application with various scenarios and optimize performance for seamless user experience.

# Realtime Digital Filter Design Application

## Step 1: Setting Up the User Interface

1. **Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - Utilize a GUI library to design the main window.
   - Add a canvas for the z-plane plot with the unit circle.

2. **Implement Zeros/Poles Placement:**
   - Allow users to click on the canvas to place zeros and poles.
   - Enable dragging for modifying the placement.
   - Implement the option to add/delete zeros and poles.

3. **Clear and Conjugate Options:**
   - Add buttons to clear all zeros, all poles, or both.
   - Provide a checkbox to enable/disable adding conjugates.

## Step 2: Frequency Response Plot

4. **Magnitude and Phase Response:**
   - Display two separate graphs for magnitude and phase responses.
   - Update the plots dynamically as users modify zeros and poles.

## Step 3: Real-time Filtering

5. **Lengthy Signal Processing:**
   - Implement a signal processing function using the designed filter.
   - Create graphs to show the time progress of the input signal and filtered output.

6. **Temporal Resolution Control:**
   - Add a slider for controlling the speed/temporal-resolution of the filtering process.

7. **Mouse Input for Real-time Signal:**
   - Allow users to input real-time signals by moving the mouse.
   - Map mouse motion to signal frequency.

## Step 4: All-Pass Filters

8. **Library of All-Pass Filters:**
   - Create a library of pre-defined all-pass filters with visualizations.

9. **Custom All-Pass Design:**
   - Implement a feature to design custom all-pass filters by specifying parameters.

10. **Enable/Disable All-Pass Elements:**
    - Add a drop-menu or checkboxes group to enable/disable added all-pass elements.

## Step 5: Phase Correction

11. **Automatic Phase Correction:**
    - Implement the addition of all-pass filters to correct the phase.

12. **User Selection of All-Pass Filters:**
    - Allow users to pick and visualize all-pass filters from the library.

## Step 6: Testing and Optimization

13. **Testing:**
    - Thoroughly test the application with various scenarios.
    - Ensure real-time processing works as expected.

14. **Optimization:**
    - Optimize the application for performance, especially during real-time signal processing.

## Step 7: Documentation and User Guidance

15. **User Guide:**
    - Create a user guide or help section explaining how to use the application.
    - Provide information on the purpose and functionality of each feature.

16. **Documentation:**
    - Document the code for future maintenance and updates.

## Step 8: Finalization

17. **Polishing:**
    - Enhance the UI for a polished look.
    - Implement error handling for user input.

18. **Deployment:**
    - Package the application for easy deployment on desktop platforms.

## Step 9: Continuous Improvement

19. **Gather Feedback:**
    - Collect user feedback for future improvements.
    - Consider user suggestions for additional features.

20. **Updates:**
    - Release updates to address bugs and add new features based on user feedback.
